## Hi there 👋

I'm Jayanth, an aspiring developer from India.

I build whatever my brain randomly spits out—no questions asked.  
If an idea pops into my head, I’ll probably turn it into a project,  
accidentally over-engineer it, and learn three new technologies I never planned to touch.

Basically: I make things, break things, and learn things… usually all at the same time.
